            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my multi-genre project exploring Toni Morrison's powerful novel "Beloved." Published in 1987, this Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece delves into the psychological and physical effects of slavery, examining themes of memory, trauma, identity, and the supernatural through the story of Sethe and her family.</p>
            <p>This project is divided into three distinct genres, each offering a different perspective on the novel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Informational:</strong> Providing context, background, and factual information about the novel and its historical setting</li>
                <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> A critical examination of the novel's themes, symbols, and narrative techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Creative:</strong> An original piano composition inspired by the novel's emotional landscape, with both audio and sheet music</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- GENRE 2: ANALYTICAL -->
        <section id="genre2" class="genre-section">
            <div class="genre-header">
                <div class="genre-number">2</div>
                <h2 class="genre-title">Genre: Analytical</h2>
            </div>
            
            <p>This analytical section examines the novel's complex themes, symbolism, and narrative techniques through close reading and critical interpretation.</p>
            
            <h3>Trauma and Memory</h3>
            <div class="analysis-container">
                <p>Morrison's concept of "rememory" is central to the novel, suggesting that traumatic experiences persist in both physical and psychological spaces. Sethe's statement that "Some things go. Pass on. Some things just stay" encapsulates how slavery's trauma refuses to remain in the past.</p>
                <p>The character of Beloved physically embodies this concept—she is simultaneously the murdered baby returned, the collective trauma of Middle Passage, and the manifestation of unprocessed grief. Her presence forces characters to confront memories they have suppressed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Motherhood Under Slavery</h3>
            <div class="analysis-container">
                <p>The novel presents motherhood as both a site of profound love and devastating vulnerability. Sethe's infamous act—killing her daughter rather than allowing her to be enslaved—represents the impossible choices faced by enslaved mothers.</p>
                <p>Morrison challenges readers to understand this act not as simple infanticide but as a complex expression of maternal love under an inhumane system. As Sethe explains, "I took and put my babies where they'd be safe."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Narrative Structure Analysis</h3>
            <div class="analysis-container">
                <p>Morrison's fragmented narrative technique mirrors the disjointed nature of traumatic memory. The novel moves between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions, requiring readers to piece together the full story gradually—much as the characters themselves must reconstruct their fractured histories.</p>
                <p>The stream-of-consciousness sections, particularly Beloved's monologue in Part 2, represent the disorienting experience of trauma and the collapse of boundaries between past and present, self and other.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Symbolism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>124 Bluestone Road:</strong> The house itself becomes a character, with its moods reflecting the psychological states of its inhabitants</li>
                <li><strong>The tree on Sethe's back:</strong> Her scarred back represents both the physical brutality of slavery and how that past is permanently inscribed on her body</li>
                <li><strong>Water imagery:</strong> Throughout the novel, water symbolizes both birth and rebirth (Beloved emerging from water) and the cleansing of memory</li>
                <li><strong>Color red:</strong> Associated with trauma, pain, and repressed memory throughout the text</li>
            </ul>

                <p>This piano improvisation titled "[Your Composition Title]" is my emotional response to Toni Morrison's "Beloved." The piece attempts to capture the novel's themes of memory, trauma, love, and redemption through musical expression. I've drawn inspiration from the novel's fragmented narrative structure, incorporating dissonant passages that resolve into moments of lyrical beauty—much like the characters' painful journeys toward healing.</p>

            <h3>Composition Notes</h3>
            <p>This composition is structured in three movements, each representing different aspects of the novel:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Memory (0:00-2:30):</strong> Opening with fragmented, repetitive motifs that represent the disjointed nature of "rememory" in the novel</li>
                <li><strong>Beloved's Return (2:31-5:15):</strong> Building tension and incorporating water-like arpeggios to symbolize Beloved's emergence from the water</li>
                <li><strong>Community and Healing (5:16-end):</strong> Gradually resolving into a more harmonious section that represents the community's role in exorcising Beloved and beginning the healing process</li>
            </ol>
